### Backprop as Functor

This is my attempt to [continue](https://github.com/bgavran/autodiff) trying to formalize and understand neural networks from the first principles.

The recent paper [Backprop as Functor](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10455) is an algebraic description of various structures one can find in neural networks.
It's an intriguing new paper that approaches the known problem from an entirely different perspective, namely, that of Category Theory.

This is my Haskell implementation of the paper and it's a work in progress.
